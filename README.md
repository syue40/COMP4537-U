- This application gives a general overview of how an API works/connects with a server and how the frontend service connects to the API.

## Lab 2:

- notice that with the mongo extension and VsCode you can enter queries or read them straight from the client

## Lab 3:
- In this lab we test basic routes for GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, and DEL to play with a unicorn NoSQL database
- We also setup Heroku hosting for our application
